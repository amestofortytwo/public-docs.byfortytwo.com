## Overview
This guide helps you connect to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Azure CLI commands.

### Prerequisites
- Azure account with necessary privileges.
- Any CLI/Azure CLI and kubelogin installed on your local machine.

### Note
- For convenience, Azure provides these commands in the Azure Portal under your AKS resource's **Connect** section. You can simply copy and paste them from there, replacing placeholders with your specific values.

### Connect to the AKS cluster

1. **Set Azure Subscription**
   - Run the following command in your terminal, replacing `<subscription-id>` with your Azure subscription ID:
     ```
     az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
     ```

2. **Get AKS Credentials**
   - Replace `<resource-group-name>` and `<cluster-name>` with your resource group and cluster name, respectively:
     ```
     az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name>
     ```

3. **Convert KubeConfig for Azure AD Integration**
   - Use kubelogin to convert your kubeconfig:
     ```
     kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l azurecli
     ```

### Conclusion
After executing these commands, you will be connected to your AKS cluster and can start managing it via `kubectl`.
