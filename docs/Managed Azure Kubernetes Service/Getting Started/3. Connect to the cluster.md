## Overview
This guide helps you connect to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Azure CLI commands.

### Prerequisites
- Azure account with necessary privileges.
- Any CLI/Azure CLI and kubelogin installed on your local machine.

!!! note
    For convenience, Azure provides the commands below in the Azure Portal under your AKS resource's Connect section. To avoid doing these steps manually - you can simply copy and paste them from there.

### Connect to the AKS cluster

1. **Log in to Azure**
    - Run the following command in your terminal:
      ```bash
      az login
      ```
    - Follow the browswer prompt and use your Microsoft SSO login to authenticate. 

2. **Set Azure Subscription**
    - Run the following command in your terminal, replacing `<subscription-id>` with your Azure subscription ID:
      ```bash
      az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
      ```

3. **Get AKS Credentials**
    - Replace `<resource-group-name>` and `<cluster-name>` with your resource group and cluster name, respectively:
      ```bash
      az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name>
      ```

4. **Convert KubeConfig for Azure AD Integration**
    - Use kubelogin to convert your kubeconfig:
      ```bash
      kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l azurecli
      ```

### Conclusion
After executing these commands, you will be connected to your AKS cluster and can start managing it via `kubectl`.
