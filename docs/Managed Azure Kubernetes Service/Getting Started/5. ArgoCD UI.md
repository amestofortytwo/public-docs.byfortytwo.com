## Overview

This guide explains how to quickly expose the Argo CD server UI in your Kubernetes cluster and authenticate using the initial admin account.

### Expose argocd-server service

1. **Change Argo CD Service Type**:
    - Edit the Argo CD server service to change its type to LoadBalancer:
      ```
      kubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
      ```

2. **Retrieve the External IP**:
    - Once the service is exposed, get the external IP:
      ```
      kubectl get svc argocd-server -n argocd -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
      ```
    !!! note
        The external IP needs to be generated and it can take a couple of seconds before its visible.

3. **Access Argo CD UI**:
    - Copy and paste the external IP to access the Argo CD UI through a web browser.

    !!! info
        The ArgoCD UI will not be secured with a certificate using this approach. You will get a warning stating `Your connection is not private`. You can ignore this and proceed by clicking `Advanced` and `Proceed to IP (unsafe)`.
        
         Use the automatically installed `ingress-nginx controller` in your cluster to issue an ingress resource for your ArgoCD UI and remove this warning.

4. **Retrieve Initial Admin Password**:
    - Get the initial admin password from the `argocd-initial-admin-secret` in the Argo CD namespace:
      ```
      kubectl get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -n argocd -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
      ```

5. **Log In**:
    - Use the username `admin` and the retrieved password to log in to the Argo CD UI.

### Conclusion

You can now access and manage your Argo CD deployments through the UI with the initial admin credentials.
