# Azure CSI Secret Driver Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide walks you through setting up the CSI Secret Driver for Azure, allowing Kubernetes to use secrets stored in Azure Key Vault using a user-assigned managed identity.

## Prerequisites
- Installed Azure Kubernetes by Fortytwo
- Access to Keyvault
- Connected to AKS Cluster in CLI

## Steps

1. **Log in to Azure Portal**
   - Navigate to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and log in with your credentials.

2. **Access Your Key Vault**
   - In the Azure Portal, find the Key Vault created by your deployment in the specified resource group.

3. **Update IAM Settings**
   - Go to the [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide) section of your Key Vault.
   - Assign yourself the necessary roles (like 'Key Vault Secrets Officer') to manage secrets.

4. **Add Secrets to Key Vault**
   - Navigate to the [Secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/about-secrets) section in your Key Vault.
   - Click on **+ Generate/Import** to add new secrets.
   - Fill in the details for your secret and click **Create**.

5. **Configure Kubernetes to Use Azure Key Vault with User-Assigned Managed Identity**
   - Use the following manifest, which utilizes a user-assigned managed identity to access your Key Vault. Replace `<key-vault-name>`, `<tenant-id>`, and `<client-id>` with your specific values.

    ```yaml
    # This is a SecretProviderClass example using user-assigned identity to access your key vault
    apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1
    kind: SecretProviderClass
    metadata:
      name: azure-kvname-user-msi
    spec:
      provider: azure
      parameters:
        usePodIdentity: "false"
        useVMManagedIdentity: "true"
        userAssignedIdentityID: <managed-identity-client-id>   # Replace with the clientID of the managed identity
        keyvaultName: <keyvault-name>                          # Replace with your Key Vault name
        objects:  |
          array:
            - |
              objectName: secret1
              objectType: secret
              objectVersion: ""
            - |
              objectName: key1
              objectType: key
              objectVersion: ""
        tenantId: <tenant-id>                                 # Replace with your Azure tenant ID
    ```
    - **Finding Tenant ID**:
      - Go to Microsoft Entra ID or to your subscription in the Azure Portal. The overview sections should contain the tenant ID.
    - **Finding Managed Identity Information**:
      - The managed identity client-id can be found in the Azure portal under the resource type "Managed Identity". Its name typically follows the format `azurekeyvaultsecretsprovider-{cluster-name}`.

    - Apply the file by running `kubectl apply -f secretproviderclass.yaml` in your terminal or CLI.

## Conclusion
After following these steps, the CSI Secret Driver will be configured in your Kubernetes cluster using Azure Key Vault with a user-assigned managed identity.
