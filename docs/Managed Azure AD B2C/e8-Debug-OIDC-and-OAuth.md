## Introduction

OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect can be a bit troublesome to get working right away.
This is generally something most people experience.

## How to debug

To help with debugging, a gentleman by the name of Nate Barbettini, have developed a couple of tools called [OAuth debugger](https://oauthdebugger.com/) and [OpenID Connect debugger](https://oidcdebugger.com/) to help this process.
To give these tools some more background and examples on how to use them, check out Nate's [Introducing the OpenID Connect debugger](https://recaffeinate.co/post/introducing-openid-connect-debugger/) post.
